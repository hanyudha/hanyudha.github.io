[Hadits](https://hadits.uinjkt.ac.id/) is a web application that I and my team create to help teacher and student to searching about hadits. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Hadits is implemented using [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), Spring makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Within one weeks, we created a responsive website.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database storage, the [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.

```js
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
